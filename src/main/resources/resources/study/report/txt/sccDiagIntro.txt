Diagnostics tests are performed to aid in understanding the underlying bias within the data and to use that to inform the final results.  The calibration plot used here is the p-value calibration plot. The p-value calibration plot is a graphical representation of P-Value Calibration.  By plotting the effect estimate on the x-axis and the standard error of the estimate on the y-axis, we can visualize the area where the traditional p-value is smaller than 0.05 (the gray area below the dashed line) and where the calibrated p-value is smaller than 0.05 (orange area).  Blue dots indicate negative controls, and those that appear in the orange area indicate a calibrated p &lt; 0.05.
