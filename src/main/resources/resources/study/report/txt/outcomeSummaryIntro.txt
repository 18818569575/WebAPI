Outcome Summary Result tables summarize at risk patients (i.e. count of people who are at risk of developing the outcome) and how many go on to become cases (i.e. persons who developed the event of interest) either under a per protocol approach (i.e. time on treatment) or an intent to treat approach (i.e. all time following treatment).  It additionally provides incidence proportions (IP) (i.e. the proportion of a population at risk who developed the outcome during a specified time period) for each approach.
