A <b>Self-Controlled Cohort Analysis</b> estimates the strength of an association by comparing the time exposed with the time unexposed among an exposed cohort.  Relative Risk Summary tables review at risk patients (i.e. the count of people who are at risk of developing the outcome), how many go on to become cases (i.e. persons who developed the event of interest), the time at risk (TAR) (i.e. the interval of time in days, relative to cohort start and cohort end for which outcomes are observable), the relative risk (RR) (i.e. the cumulative incidence during the time exposed relative to the cumulative incidence during the time unexposed), and the 95% confidence interval for the RR.
